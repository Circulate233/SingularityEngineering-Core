# BetterMeteorite (1.12)

This mod modifies the meteorite generation mechanism in AE2UEL, allowing for the replacement of the outer and core blocks of meteorites (outer sky stone and inner sky stone chest), and allowing for the customization of the blocks pointed to by the meteorite compass. You can modify these settings in the configuration file.

By default, it will replace the core blocks with mysterious blocks ported from Minecraft 1.18+AE2.
